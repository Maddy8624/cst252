		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> There were no problems when it came to completing this lab. However, javascripting is a
		new concept, while we were able to complete the lab we are still getting use to the idea of javascripting.
	 	Functions also kind of confusing, but I am getting use to them slowly.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The results are what you see on this lab page. This lab was successfully complete and all
			of the required content is included. See the javascript down below.</p>
