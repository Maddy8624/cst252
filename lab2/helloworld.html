		<p>Hello world this is my second website that I have created. The first was in CST251.
			In CST 252 we will learn more advanced HTML and CSS, as well as be introduced to Javascript.
			My partner for the semester is Michael Owen. We didn't know each other before this semester
			and partnered up together through Slack. I am a Communication Design major with an empahasis
			in Visual Design as well as a Cinematic Arts and Technology major. My ultimate goal is to be
			a designer for the film and television industry of some sort. I'm excited to enhance my coding skills
			by taking CST 252.</p>
